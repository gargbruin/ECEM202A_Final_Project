# Strengths of this work

* As shown in Related Work section, most of the work in this area uses a combinations of sensors at multiple locations. Such combination of multiple sensors provides a good set of distinguishing features which makes it easy for the model to detect multiple activities. Whereas, in this project we are using only two sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) that too only on the wrist. This limited set of sensors made it difficult for our model to distinguish between activities. To fix this problem, we have used multiple approaches such as merging similar activities, adding untargeted activities, adding features like mean and standard deviation etc. Detecting human activities only from
