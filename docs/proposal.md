1. Why activity tracking is useful?
2. Why wearables are good for this?
3. Spread of ML
The recent advancements of Artificial Intelligence (AI) have make the human being more inclined towards novel research aims in recognizing the objects, learning the environment, time series analysis and predicting the forthcoming sequences. Nowadays there is a growing interest of AI researchers towards Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) which compromises massive applications in the fields of speech recognition, language modeling, video processing and also time series analysis. Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is one of the challenging problems which seeks answers in this wonderful AI field. It can be mainly used for eldercare and childcare as an assistive technology combined with technologies like Internet of Things (IoT). This article presents an approach to predict human activities developed using CNN and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) on the basis of the UCI HAR dataset.
