# Overview

With the ubiquitous presence of smart wearable devices like Apple Watch, Fitbit bands etc around us, a huge amount of data is now available for data mining research and data mining applications. These devices have powerful sensors like Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), Photoplethysmogram (PPG), GPS and audio sensors which are capable of reading and processing the data quite accurately and in real time. A lot of machine learning based techniques have been proposed to generate insights from the collected sensor data.

# Goals
The project is aimed to build a system which can use either classical models (e.g. Naive Bayes, random forests, SVMs) or neural models (LSTM, TCN etc.) to accurately detect and log the activity using the sensor data (from the IMU and heart-rate sensor embedded in the wearables). Such a system can have a large number of applications. There is a possibility of providing a highly personalised and customised experience of smart devices like phones and watches. Also it can be determined if the user is following a healthy exercise routine or not.
