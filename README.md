## Overview
With the ubiquitous presence of smart wearable devices like Apple Watch, Fitbit bands etc around us, a huge amount of data is now available for data mining research and data mining applications. These devices have powerful sensors like Inertial Measurement Units (IMU), Photoplethysmogram (PPG), GPS and audio sensors which are capable of reading and processing the data quite accurately and in real time. A lot of classical or machine learning based techniques have been proposed to generate insights from the collected sensor data.

One such area where this sensor data can be used is Human Activity Recognition (HAR) which refers to predicting what a person is doing from the series of the observation of personâ€™s action. This is an active area of research. HAR provides personalized support for various applications and is associated with a wide range of fields of study like medicinal services, dependable automation developing, and smart surveillance system.

## Project Goals
The project is aimed to build a system which uses machine learning models to accurately detect and log the human activity using the sensor data (from the IMU embedded in the wearables). Such a system can have a large number of applications. There is a possibility of providing a highly personalised and customised experience of smart devices like phones and watches. Also it can be determined if the user is following a healthy exercise routine or not.

Following figure shows the overview of our HAR system:

## Conclusion and Future Scope
The recent advancements in machine learning can be applied to the very important field of Human Activity Recognition (HAR). In this project, we shown once such successful approach in applying deep learning to detect 4 different day-to-day activities (Walking, Sitting, Eating, Brushing Teeth). This work can be extended to include more activities by adding more sensors (such as heart-rate monitor) and by using new advancements in machine learning.
